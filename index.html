                How to use this guide?

            <p>
                    The 'create first, ask questions later' method might present an unorthodox approach to
                    introductory Computer Science concepts, but it's one that really beckons readers
                    to internalize the abstractions they're dealing with in a way that makes 'tangible' sense to them.
                    Making the intangible 'tangible' is what visual illusion and computer graphics are all about.
                    The more you can take these projects and turn them into something of your own--
                    whether it's as simple as changing a few details or entirely reinventing the project from scratch-- 
                    the better. 
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    These lessons begin with the very basic fundamentals. Some may introduce programming concepts you're already familiar with. I encourage you to skim and skip as much content as you need to in order to get to the chapter or project that perks your interest the most, or If you feel the pace becomes unneccessarily granular.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                     These potentially 'unorthodox' examples are offered to spare newcomers and young students an extra burden of abstraction or syntax, at least until they've built up the confidence and rigor needed for it to become second nature to them. (Such as navigating the x, y coordinate grid of a programming canvas.)

                What is a Programming Language?
            </h1> 
         

            <p>
                A programming language is a way of providing instructions to the computer.
                 All programs, whether theyâ€™re games like Warcraft and Zelda, or an applications like the browser you're using
                 to read this webpage, are written in some kind of programming language. The 'core' programming language
                 we'll be using to create the projects ahead is JavaScript.
