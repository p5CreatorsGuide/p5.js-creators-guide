                Please note this page is a work in progress. Any suggestions on how to improve the accuracy or
                accessibility would be much appreciated. The work presented here would not be possible
                without the foundational efforts and outreach carried out by the Processing foundation.
                Their excellent teachers, including Daniel Shiffman, Lauren McCarthy and # inspired these
                 series of lessons that hope to form a non-traditional learning pathway for learners
                 of any age seeking an introduction to basic Computer Science concepts. As a printmaking instructor
                 turned Computer Science educator, I've witnessed, first-hand, a 
                 broad demographic of learners engage with these concepts, even when they're far beyond their years
                 Through the affodances of visual programming and creative ownership I hope the reach is greater.

                Many of these lessons were created for the

                One of the most miraculous things about being human lies in the fact that we
                 are able to teach and learn-- even from those who have lived long before us.
                  Thanks to the miracle of the human brain, we are able to internalize knowledge that's shared and taught to us rather than having to rediscover something firsthand every time there's something new we must learn or do.

            <p>
                These 18 lessons are split between three 'editions'.
                I. Drawing and Design
                II. Animation
                II. Interaction

                The create first, ask questions later method might present an unorthodox approach to
                introductory Computer Science concepts, but it's one that really beckons readers
                to internalize the abstractions their dealing with in a way that makes sense to them.
                Making the intangible 'tangible' is what visual illusion and computer graphics are all about.
                The more you can take these projects, source code, lessons and make them your own,
                whether it's as simple as a color change or a complete reinvention-- the better.

                What is a Programming Language?
            </h1> 

            <p>
                A programming language is a way of providing instructions to the computer.
                 All programs, whether theyâ€™re a game like Minecraft and Zelda or applications like
calculators, Google Chrome or MicrosoftWord are written in some kind of programming language.
            </p>

                What is JavaScript?
            </h1>
            
            <p>
                JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in the world. It is used to power nearly every website on the internet. JavaScript is not to be confused with Java, which is a different programming language altogether. Where most programming languages need to be compiled (IE. translated) into machine code locally on your device, JavaScript is interpreted line by line thanks to our web browsers.
            </p>

                What is p5.js?
            </h1>

            <p>
                p5.js is a specific JavaScript library. It enhances JavaScripts capabilities by making it simpler to program graphics and animations thanks to contributions from a community of open source programmers!
