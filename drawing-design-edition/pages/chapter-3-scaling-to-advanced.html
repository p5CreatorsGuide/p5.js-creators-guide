            <p>
               Let's take a moment to think about the units of the grid Code Naturally provides our programming canvas. Even though our computer screens are, nowadays, comprised of thousands of pixels, the Beginner grid counts up by one and only reaches up to 20 across the x axis and 20 down the y axis. If an average laptop screen resolution is 1300 by 1000 pixels, how is the Beginner canvas able to span most of our laptop screen without  this?
            </p>

            <p> We at Code Naturally took that 20 by 20 pixel space, which is about the size of your thumbnail compared to your computer screen, and we scaled the canvas up 50 times to make it appear larger on our screens than it actually is. This way, we are able to see what our javaScript code is doing on the smallest, visual level, pixel by pixel. The Advanced grid is 1000 by 1000 pixels. The Beginner grid is only 20 by 20 pixels. This means in order to make a beginner sketch appear properly on an advanced sketch, we must multiply the specific values of your beginner sketch (the x and y coordinates, as well as the width and height parameters of each shape) by 50 in order to resize it to fit the Advanced Grid.  
            </p>

            <p> 
               As stated previously, if we're first starting to work our programmer muscles, it's a great idea to list and work out each shape and parameter you need to modify on paper before you start changing your code. Your work on paper can be anything from a quick doodle with labels, to a list of words that can later become the bindings for your variables.

            <p class = "subheader">
                Before you resize your former project to fit properly on the Advanced canvas, you need to multiply each individual parameter by 50. If doing long-hand multiplication out on paper for each parameter sounds daunting to you, realize you can use the multiplication math operator: * that is built into the javaScript language. This way, we can simply ask our computers to evaluate the multiplication problem that is in place of a parameter. Our computer will then multiply each parameter of our Beginner illustration so it fits properly within the Advanced canvas.

            <p>
                Below are most the math and arithmetic operations you can use with literal numbers as well as variables. Some operations, such as incrementing, can also be written out in a longer format using the assignment operator ( = ). We refer to this long-hand format of incrementing as a Math Expression.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember, equal signs are used for assignment and comparison alone. Just by including a math operator, that line of code becomes an expression which is computed. The final value is always returned to the console. Even if we don't see any changes on our canvas visually, math operations are carried out and compiled all the same.
