                Although constantly visualizing the 'grid' of your project canvas can be
                 overwhelming, that's not all we must at least be aware of when creating
                  illustrations. There are two functions provided within every p5.js editor
                  sketch or project: <span class = "blue-code" >function setup() { }</span>
                and <span class = "blue-code">function draw() { }</span>. In order to understand
                 how both of these functions work, we have to understand that our
                  browsers, the software we use to request and view different web pages, interprets
                   or reads our code line by line, in the order the lines of code were written.
 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class = "egText">
                Although the programming canvas for your p5.js sketch is 
                blank until you write some code, it helps to imagine a grid originating from 
                the top left corner of your canvas (0,0) that increases from left to right across the 
                X axis, and top to bottom along the Y axis. <br /><br />
            </p>
            <img class = "instructionalImg" src = "../image/ch4/c4_editor-grid-overlay.png"></img> 
            <br/>
            <p class = "egText" ><br /> Each shape used in a p5.js sketch 
                exists upon the (invisible) X, Y coordinate grid of your programming canvas (or HTML canvas, but more on that later).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p> 
                Even though it may look as if our computer is executing our code in a single instant, 
                JavaScript, the programming language that the p5.js library was built on,
                 actually interprets our code from the first line that's written until the last.
                 This is why when we begin illustrating with p5.js shape functions (like <span class = "blue-code">rect()</span> and <span class = "blue-code">ellipse()</span>),
                  we notice that the final shape function called on the last line of our code is always 
                  the top-most visible 'layer' on our canvas. Unless, of course, a loop or conditional 
                  satement is in affect. (But we really should worry about understanding what those are that <i>after</i> we feel comfortable layering multiple shape function calls to design and illustrate our basic ideas.)
            </p>
            <br/>
            <img class = "instructionalImg" src="../image/ch4/c4_star-outlines.svg"></img>
            </br>
            <p class= "egText">
                    As you can see, there is more than one way we can design a star illustration
                    using basic shape functions. But overlapping stroke lines can be distracting. Using noStroke(); and a 
                   fill function, we remove any distracting outlines, presenting you with a complete, 
                   complex shape.
            </p>
            </br>
            </br>
            <img class = "instructionalImg" src = "../image/ch4/c4_star-fills.svg"></img>
            <p>
                It's as if every line of code that calls a shape function is telling your 
                browser to cut that shape out of pixelated construction paper, and then glue it down on 
                top of your programming canvas in the place you described-- regardless of whether or 
                not something has already been drawn on that X, Y coordinate. This is also why when 
                you include the <span class = "blue-code">background()</span> color function on the last line of your 
                project's code, then the very last instruction your web browser would interpret and execute is
                placing an opaque background color on top of all the visuals that are drawn before that final instruction.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Being able to slow down and break down each step the web browser is carrying out as 
                a result of your code is a skill that naturally develops over time, and a very important
                 one at that. Thankfully, programming visual projects makes it easier to form this understanding of how and when 
              lines of JavaScript code we write are being executed, (at least within our p5.js sketch). <span class = "blue-code">function setup() { }</span> and 
              <span class = "blue-code">function draw() { }</span> allow us to control the flow and order of our instructions even further.

                and Preparing your Project Canvas
                <br /> with the createCanvas() Function

            <br />
            <p>
                You can think of <span class = "blue-code">function setup() { }</span> as your program's start up process. 
                Just as photographers need to load film into older cameras and painters 
                need to prepare their brushes and canvas before they begin painting, 
                p5.js requires a specific start up procedure before we're able to draw 
                anything to our own programming canvas by writing code.
            </p>
        </br>
        <p>
                Even if you were to leave the curly brackets <span class = "blue-code">{ }</span> 
                of <span class = "blue-code">function setup() { }</span>
            empty, your p5.js code would still cary out a beginning procedure which, by
             default, provides your screen with a very tiny 100 x 100 pixel canvas or drawing space 
             (which can be changed in the settings menu of your project). One way to take advantage of function setup ( ) by creating a canvas with specific diemensions using:
        </p>
    </br>
        <img class = "instructionalImg" src = "../image/ch4/create-canvas.svg"></img>
    </br>
    
            <p class = "egText">The 
                    <span class = "blue-code">createCanvas(</span>
                    <span class = "red-code">width</span>
                    <span class = "blue-code">,</span>
                    <span class = "red-code">height</span>
                     <span class = "blue-code">);</span> 
                     function allows you to specify what size you'd like your programming canvas to be.

               Again, itâ€™s easy to underestimate what kinds of shapes we can program. If there are
                certain shapes that feel impossible to realize in code, try drawing them out 
                on grid paper beforehand. After you've successfully combined simple shapes
                to create more complex ones, try attempting to illustrate an entire landscape 
                inside the curly brackets <span class = "blue-code">{ }</span> of 
                <span class = "blue-code">function setup() { }</span>.

                    function draw() { }</span>, although it's quite a bit different than
                    <span class = "blue-code">function setup() { }</span>. We'll be
                    exploring how, why and what possibilities these differences unlocks for us in the <a>next chapter.</a>
