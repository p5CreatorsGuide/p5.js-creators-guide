                   In JavaScript, every piece of data we end up working with is a value. Regardless of whether the value is a number, a string or a boolean, some values need to be created or assigned, while others are already provided to us. For example, think back to when you created your very first variable. Before you could apply var moveX to your cool unicorn design, you had to declare it. Yet at the same time, if you recall the first shape you may have learned, the point function-- you never recall needing to declare "point" before being able to draw a point to your screen.

                    The same is true for all of the basic shape functions provided to us in Code Naturally. Even though functions are values: data that includes we don't have to declare shape functions before we use them.  We don't even have to understand how they're made. All we need to understand is how to use them: which includes knowing the right names to call them with, and the parameters (or lack thereof) that are necessary to make them work.
